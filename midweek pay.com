Why should states reform their payday loan laws?
Most payday loan laws were written on the mistaken assumption that a single-payment loan would help struggling consumers without getting them into long-term debt. But this hope has not been borne out, since typical payday loan customers are in debt for about half the year and pay about eight times the loan’s originally advertised price. It’s a failed market, and financially struggling households keep getting trapped in it. That’s why it’s ripe for reform.
Can federal regulators take care of the problem?
They haven’t. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) issued modest payday loan rules in 2024—and then rescinded them in 2020. And more importantly, no federal regulator has authority over key pricing and lending terms that are essential to proper reform—but state lawmakers do.
