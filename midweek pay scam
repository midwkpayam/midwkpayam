Modern payday lending, with its two-week timelines, high costs, and lump-sum payments, emerged in the early 1990s. According to The Pew Charitable Trusts' most recent market scan, 18 states and Washington, D.C., do not have payday loan stores because their laws limit interest rates and other terms, while four of the remaining 32 states have enacted comprehensive payday and small-dollar loan reforms.

In this interview, Alex Horowitz, who has led Pewâ€™s small-dollar loans research for more than 10 years, discusses how policymakers and advocates can successfully reform their state lending laws.
